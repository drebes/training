TERRAFORM ERROR CODES

1. Error Deleting a Resource
-----------------------------
Example:
* google_compute_network.vpc_demo: Error waiting for Deleting Network:
The network resource 'projects/[PROJECT]]/global/networks/[VPC]'
is already being used by
'projects/[PROJECT]]/regions/europe-west2/subnetworks/[SUBNET]'

Solution:
Manually delete the subnet [SUBNET] and then run
'./remove.sh' again to delete the [VPC]


2. Error 409 - resource already exists
--------------------------------------
Example:
* google_compute_network.vpc_demo: Error creating Network: googleapi: Error 409:
The resource 'projects/[PROJECT]/global/networks/[VPC]'
already exists, alreadyExists

Solution:
Manually delete [VPC] on GCP console and then run 'init.sh' script again


3. 'oauth2: cannot fetch token: 400 Bad Request'
-----------------------------------------------
The error suggests that terraform cannot find the
gcloud auth credentials for the user logged into Cloudshell.

Authenticate to gcloud again using:
[[ $CLOUD_SHELL ]] || gcloud auth application-default login

If this does not work, then consider resetting your CLOUD_SHELL
to its default state.

If you have resources deployed by Terraform already, you will have to manually
delete them from the cloud console.
